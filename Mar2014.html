  <p>27/03/2014 - Been working hard on the day job and so not much time over the last week, however just managed to get the JSImongo alpha code up to git hub for the first time. Also posted this week some HOW TO notes on setting up an AWS Cloud web server that may help some of the community looking to do this for the first time. The HOW TOO's are off the home page. Looking to get sample code posted here that is more related to the myJarvis piece over the next week and this will post tweets up into mongoDB.</p>

            <p>18/03/2014 - This week I have de-coupled both the day time element and the delay element from the code and added these to the jsiconfig.txt
            file to allow for easy modification. Edit the 4th and 5th line of the config file to adjust accordingly. Essentially 900 here equates to
            960 mins if the delay is written in as 60000ms (60 seconds) and would give a realtime trading day of 16hrs.  As this is a simulation you can move this write down do a 1ms delay that depending on network and cpu spped will give you the fastest results but will randomise the date time selection written in as per the JSON.  Keep in mind the number of days you have also configured here and if inserting to mongo the network speed will effect performance.</p>

            <p>12/03/2014 - Fixed some issues with the website here, added the follow twitter button and the link to mongodb labs. </p>

            <p>12/03/2014 - This week I have cleaned up the code a little and added a couple of functions. First I have added the dates and entities functionality, this allows the simulation of multiple dates simply by amending the dateslist.txt file. In addition the entities funcitonality gives simulations of products being sold across mutiple entities / shops / offices etc. I have also added the -i and -d commands when you execute jsimongo. -i disables the insertion into mongoDB to allow for testing. -d allows you to disable the display function to the console. Without these set the default will be to insert and display the transactions.</p>

            <p>05/03/2014 - In terms of development, the top priorities for me at the moment is to improve settings functions and allow these to be entered external to the code. The next feature I would like to add is to be able to run the code across a number of days/time periods as currently this is restrictive although not impossible. A tidy up of the website is certainly due as well.</p>

            <p>05/03/2014 - I have reviewed the website since applying the latest batch of changes and from putting the alpha version up
            and for JSImongo and I have modified some of website text. My aim is to bring JSI up to a beta version over the next month or 
            so but first I have setup a public facing GIT Repository - https://github.com/philnorthmount.  Also I have created a JSI specific twitter account Tweet - @PhilT74564531.  I am now in the process of setting up ANT as the code deployment tool and once I am happy with this process will continue with development.</p>

            <p>04/03/2014 - JSImongo is now available as a pre-beta version to download on the downloads page.</p>

            <p>04/03/2014 - Jango is now renamed as JSImongo - this stands for Java Simulated for Mongo for two reasons Jango is a name of a music provider and I do not want any to have to change the name later and after some though we think JSImongo is more descriptive name anyway for its purpose</p>
